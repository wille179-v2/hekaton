Hekaton is a world with literally infinite resources and the ability to pull some of those resource practically from thin air (akin to Vulcanus's lava or Vestra's gasses, but without needing Calcite). However, a lot of the basic resources are needed in truly vast quantities, while the specialty resources often need to be transported in bulk over long distances. Hekaton also has three Moons (Cottus, Briareus, and Gyges), which are also rich in unique, infinite resources but pose their own challenges.
	- Cottus is infested with every single enemy type simultaneously, but on deathworld settings. It has infinite oil and holmium solution just spilling out of the ground, plus the ability to compress fluid products down to much smaller sizes for easy transport, but using those processes generates massive amounts of pollution. Worse, it entirely lacks copper, so keeping a base alive depends on your space logistics.
	- Gyges is highly radioactive (and a source of infinite uranium and a new resource: plutonium); the player must deploy a remote spidertron and construct everything via orbital drops and remote-view manufacturing.
	- Briareus is a very liquid world with a chemical soup of resources (including lithium, fluorine, and a new resource: cobalt). Processing that soup in meaningful quantities takes a huge amount of space, which is at a premium on a world nearly entirely devoid of solid land and stone.
	- Hekaton itself is a near ideal place to build a factory. It has strong solar, rivers of lava, steam geysers, and patches of ore (calcite, elemental sulfur, tungsten) that literally never deplete. It also has minimal cliffs and a broad, open landscape. However, its native science pack is EXTREMELY costly with a fairly long (but not all that complex) crafting chain and its technologies are incredibly expensive to research (fast, but use a lot of science packs to the point that lab throughput becomes a concern).
	
	
New Resources:
	- Elemental Sulfur (can be directly mined on Hekaton)
	- Cobalt (Can be chemically extracted from Briareus's sea)
	- Thorium & Plutonium (the former can be used to power a breeder reactor that turns uranium into plutonium)
	- Metal-Polymer Slurry (can be separated into crude oil and holmium solution, found in pools on Cottus)

Rewards: Hekaton's rewards are all about mass production on a colossal scale.
	- New Long Inserter Types (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/kry-inserters) and an Extra-Long inserter (3 tiles).
	- Plutonium Rocket Fuel (An even more energy-efficient fuel source with a bonkers top speed for trains)
	- Batteries (Train fuel that only requires electricity to recharge, slightly less potent than rocket fuel for speed)
	- Long Distance Logistics
